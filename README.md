# SQL_Recipe_Party
 It's like Recipe Party, but this time it's connected to a SQL database.

# Overview


I wanted to better improve on my Recipe program, so I decided to use SQL to store recipes, filter recipes, and pull up recipes. This program will get a recipe information from the user and then save it to a SQL database. The user can then review the information later.

# Relational Database

There are a total of three tables in my database. One is the recipe table which contains basic information 
about the recipe. The ingredient table help all the ingredients, and the directions table held the recipe directions.

# Development Environment

I used both Visual Studio Code and MySQL during making this project.

I used python, sqlite3, and regular SQL

# Future Work


- I would like to add a completed filtered to the code.
- I think it would be great if there were less while loops.
- I would prefer it if the view recipe and stuff was a little more easy to read.
