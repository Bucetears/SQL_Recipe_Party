# SQL_Recipe_Party
 It's like Recipe Party, but this time it's connected to a SQL database.

# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}

I wanted to better improve on my Recipe program, so I decided to use SQL to store recipes, filter recipes, and pull up recipes. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

There are a total of three tables in my database. One is the recipe table which contains basic information 
about the recipe. The ingredient table help all the ingredients, and the directions table held the recipe directions.

# Development Environment

I used both Visual Studio Code and MySQL during making this project.

I used python, sqlite3, and regular SQL

# Useful Websites

# Future Work


- I would like to add a completed filtered to the code.
- I think it would be great if there were less while loops.
- I would prefer to make the amounts of the ingredients separate from the food so we could filter by individual food items in the future.
